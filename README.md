## random python things

I'm compiling a list of projects/books for personal study.

## what i'm currently working on

    - think complexity - green tea press
    - doing math with python - no starch press
    - pong using python's turtle graphics

## ultimate plan

Expand upon interesting chapters into useful portfolio projects.
