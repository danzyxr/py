## random python things

I'm compiling a list of projects/books for personal study.

## what i'm currently working on

- think python - green tea press
- modeling and simulation - green tea press
- doing math with python - no starch press

## ultimate plan

Expand upon interesting chapters into cool portfolio projects. :)  
Most exercises will evolve into individual modules worth looking at.  
This repo will serve as a fun playground where these ideas live.
